**Boundary Element Simulations for Spherical Contact on Radial Wavy Surface

This repository contains Python code implementing boundary element simulations to analyze the contact between a sphere and a radial wavy surface. The number of waves on the surface is varied to study the effect on contact mechanics and stress distribution.

**Key Features

**Boundary Element Method (BEM)**: Efficient numerical method for solving boundary integral equations.
**Spherical Contact**: Simulates the interaction between a sphere and a wavy surface.
**Radial Wavy Surface**: Varying the number of waves to investigate their influence on contact mechanics.
**Contact Mechanics Analysis**: Calculates contact area, pressure distribution, and stress concentration.
